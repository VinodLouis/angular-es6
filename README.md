# angular-es6

Small Demo of how to use angular Js with ES6


## Prerequisites

- Node Js https://nodejs.org/
- Webpack http://webpack.github.io/


### Running the Application in development mode
1. Clone the repo on your machine
2. Go into the root folder
3. Do an ```npm install``` (which will install all the dependencies)
4. Then hit ```npm run webpack-dev-server``` and wait for the server to run
5. Open your browser pointing at http://localhost:9002/app/dist/index.html#/home


### Running the Application for production
* The concept here is to get all teh files in single build i.e in app/dist/js/build-js.js

1. From root folder run ```npm run webpack-dev``` This will unify all code into common build
2. Now you can run the index.html independently without the app reference
