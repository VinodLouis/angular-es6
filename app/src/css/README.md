# Location guidelines

There are times when you need to use raw CSS from other people's projects. In the case that CSS is not available in a
SASS format, then organize those in this location.

* In case where native SASS distributions are available, then they *do not* belong here.
* Place CSS into their respective directories, with a top level directory clearly indicating the component to which this CSS belongs to.
